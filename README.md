Hi I'm naiquire, and I'm currently studying AQA Computer Science at A-level along with some other subjects. I'm currently learning Japanese currently which is mostly for fun but also for watching anime - I also already speak somewhat fluent French. Sometimes I get some spare time, which usually ends up with playing osu! or something, but occasionally I'll do some programming. Also my favourite pokemon is Sylveon.

I don't have too many projects yet, but please do take a look around. I'll occasionally publish snippets of code from my personal college work, so some projects might interest you. I don't get enough free time to work on a full project right now, especially with the amount of homework I get, so most of my repos are small projects or past challenges from AoC (pre 2024 is private). Although, I am currently working on a server-client network to host a real-time chat application, and in the future whatever sort of projects I make that end up requiring a server connection.

## üåê Languages
- Mainly C#
- I use Python sometimes
- A bit of C++

## üõ†Ô∏è Current Projects
- Main focus right now is setting up a server-client network
- Weekly projects for college but repos are private for now
- Project Euler (not stored in a repo)
- Geode-SDK modding framework for Geometry Dash
