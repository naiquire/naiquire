# こんにちは
Hi I'm naiquire, and I'm currently studying Computer Science at A-level along with Maths, Further Maths, and Physics. Sometimes I get some time to myself, which usually ends up with me coding something that no one wants or will ever need.

I don't have too many projects yet, but do take a look if you're interested. I'll occasionally publish snippets of code from my personal college work, so some projects might interest you. I don't get enough free time to work on a full project right now, so most of my repos are solutions to popular coding challenge websites (Project Euler, AOC, etc.)

## 🌐 Languages
- Mainly C#
- I use Python sometimes
- A bit of C++

## 🛠️ Current Projects
- Main focus right now is the advent of code 2024
- Weekly projects for college but repos are private for now
- Project Euler (not stored in a repo)
